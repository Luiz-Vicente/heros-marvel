# Heros Marvel

In this project we consume the Marvel API to list the Marvel Heroes.
This project was created some time ago for a technical evaluation and I decided to finish it, I adjusted all the visual points I found but I will always maintain it here.

## Techs used here:
- Vue.js
- NPM
- Bootstrap 5
- Axios
- Mixpanel
- Vue Notifications
- Vue Spinner
- Vue Router


## How to run

To run this project on your machine you need to have installed:

- Vue.js
- Node.js
- NPM

go into the heros-marvel folder and run the following command:
```
npm install
```
after installing all dependencies a 'node_modules' folder should be created. In this case, just run this command:
```
npm run serve
```
